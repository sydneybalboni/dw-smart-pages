Great Lakes Future Exhibit,"Welcome to Great Lakes Future at Discovery World! The Great Lakes are like five giant bathtubs filled with fresh water. Together, they hold so much water that they could fill 50 million swimming pools! These lakes—Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario—are super important for animals, plants, and people. At this exhibit, you’ll play games, watch videos, and explore fun activities to learn all about them!

Each lake is special in its own way. Lake Superior is the biggest and deepest—it’s so big it could hold all the water from the other lakes and still have room! Lake Michigan has cool sand dunes you can climb, and Lake Huron has the most shoreline, like a big, twisty beach. Lake Erie is the warmest and best for fishing, and Lake Ontario helps connect the Great Lakes to the ocean.

You’ll also learn how to keep the lakes safe and clean. There are problems like trash and invasive animals that hurt the lakes, but don’t worry! Scientists, kids, and grown-ups are working together to fix them. You can try fun activities to see how we can all help protect the lakes.

Come explore the Great Lakes and see why they’re one of the coolest and most important parts of our planet. You can help take care of them, too, so they stay clean and healthy for everyone to enjoy!","Welcome to *Great Lakes Future* at Discovery World!
